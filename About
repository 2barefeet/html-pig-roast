    <h3>
        We're gearing up for our 61st Annual Muse Pig Roast, and we wouldn't dream of celebrating without you and your family! Save the date: June 22nd is going to be a day filled with good food, great company, and even better memories.
        <br/>
        As members of the Muse Tech family, whether still serving or retired from the military, our bond runs deep. This event isn't just about the pig on the spit; it's about the stories shared, the laughter that fills the air, and the genuine connections we cherish.
        <br/>
        Join us for a day of catching up, reminiscing, and celebrating the camaraderie that makes our community so special. Come hungry, come happy, and come ready for a fantastic time!
